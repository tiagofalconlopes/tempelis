# tempelis
A Java software to retrieve files' names based on text pattern search
This software represents an effort to make easy for noncoders to retrieve text files containing specific patterns.
For example, it can also be used to search part of sequences in multiple fastq files and retrieve the files' names.
Or maybe, you just want to know which files, tables, contain someones' name or values.

#Getting Started
Download the main repository;
Unzip it on the desired directory;
The executable file is in the directory "/Tempelis/dist/" of the downloaded repository;
Double click the JAR file (tempelis.jar);
Choose if you'd like to search for a pattern;
Insert the pattern to be found (this software accepts regex and is case insensitive);
Type the output file's name (it will be save in your home directory).
